<p style="margin: 0 10px">The South Church Library isn't just a room. We've got books too! Now you can check out our entire collection of
    books from wherever you are. You can even check them out and take them home for a while! Feel free to stop in
    and say hello (you know, once it's safe to do so).</p>

<p style="margin: 0 10px">This website was created by Justin and Lucas Bacchi in 2021 as part of Lucas's Eagle Scout Service Project. Lucas, along
    with family, friends, and other members of Troop 76 in Ballardvale, created this website and the database of
    books that powers it. Thank you to all who volunteered!</p>
