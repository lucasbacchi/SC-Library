<p class="question">Q: How do I check out a book?</p>
<p class="answer">A: Great question! We love that you're so enthusatic to start using the library!
    Right now, you can only check out books in person using the paper checkout cards. We're working on a way to allow you
    to check out books using the online system, but that feature is still in development. Stay tuned!</p>
