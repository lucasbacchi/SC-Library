            <ul class="help">
                <li>Enter the book's ISBN number. If you have a barcode scanner at hand, click into the text box
                    and then scan the book. If you don't have a scanner, you'll have to type it manually and then
                    click "Add Entry". The code should recognize both ISBN10 and ISBN13, but if one doesn't work,
                    try the other. If your book does not have an ISBN, there is a link below that field to enter
                    a book manually.
                </li>
                <li>You should now be directed to a form. If you entered an ISBN number, then many of the fields
                    will be filled out for you. It's still a good idea to double-check this data before submitting
                    the form. You'll also need to add any information that is missing (including SC specific data
                    like purchase date and price).
                </li>
                <li>Once you've filled out the form with all of the required data, click the "Save" button at the
                    bottom of the page. Once you do that, you'll get a barcode number for the book. If you need to
                    print out a new barcode, see "Print Out Barcodes" below.

                    "Search" button below. You should see a list of books that match that search query. Click on
                    the book you wish to edit. (Tip: You can also get to the edit entry form by clicking the small
                    pencil icon in the upper-right-hand corner, assuming you're logged in as an admin.)
                </li>
                <li>You should now be directed to a form. The existing data for the book you clicked on should be

                    form.

                    any major edits or additions, so that you always have a copy that's reasonably up-to-date just
                    in case the website breaks.

                    it will time out if it takes longer than 30 seconds). When it finishes, you should see a popup
                    telling you that the database has been uploaded successfully.
